Credits to G8JNJ for the original design. I just made it simpler to build with the PCBs.
A broadband matching unit compatible with multiple element lengths and configurations.
This is the same style matching unit found in the 'tacticool' antennas without the painful price point.
intial test of a 30ft radiator and 25ft counterpoise with very poor deployment yeilded most bands under 3:1.
More updates will be posted here as I have time to test the unit.

Untested configurations that this unit should work with:

17ft vertical no counterpoise

30ft radiator and 25ft counterpoise

60ft radiator and 25ft counterpoise

73ft radiator and 25ft counterpoise

108ft radiator and 25ft counterpoise




**BOM:**

- BN43-7051 bino toroid

- 6mm OD .2mm wall thickness copper tubing

- 18ga PTFE teflon high temp wire- 2ft minimum

- PCB top and bottom

- 2 bolts with hex nuts and wing nuts for terminals

- Housing and connector of choice

- Radiator(s) of choice


**Instructions:**

- Cut copper tubing to length, 37mm is the shortest I recommend.

- Place PCBs with tracing facing away from toroid to protect it from heat. Make sure the offsets are on the same side of the toroid. solder copper tubing into PCBs.

- On PCB with two solder contacts, with the offsets facing down the right side is the positive contact. The left side is to wrap the toroid. 

- Using 12in of wire solder the left contact with the wire leading away from the toroid. Run the wire into the opposite side copper tube.

- Both copper tubes should have 2 passes of the wire. After the second wrap turn the wire back into the left side tube and out the top. This will be your antenna connection.

- Solder a length of wire to the right side contact, this will be your positive connection.

- The last contact at the top of the toroid on the side will be for ground. Pass your wire through the bottom hole and solder into top contact. 

- When connecting ground to your terminal run another length of wire to ground on your connector. 

- Solder wires to terminals, positive to your connector and place in a housing. Offsets are there to prevent the unit from contacting and melting the housing due to the loss associated with this type of matching unit.
