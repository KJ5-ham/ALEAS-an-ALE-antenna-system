Credits to G8JNJ for the original design. I just made it simpler to build with the PCBs.
This is the same style matching unit found in the 'tacticool' antennas without the painful price point.
intial test of a 30ft radiator and 25ft counterpoise with very poor deployment yeilded most bands under 3:1.

Untested configurations that this unun should work with:
17ft vertical no radials
30ft radiator and 25ft counterpoise
60ft radiator and 25ft counterpoise
73ft radiator and 25ft counterpoise
108ft radiator and 25ft counterpoise

BOM:
BN43-7051 bino toroid

6mm OD .2mm wall thickness copper tubing

18ga PTFE teflon high temp wire- 2ft minimum

PCB top and bottom

2 bolts with hex nuts and wing nuts for terminals

Housing and connector of choice

Radiator of choice

25ft counterpoise wire


Cut copper tubing to length, 37mm is the shortest I recommend.
Place PCBs with tracing facing away from toroid to protect it from heat. Make sure the offsets are on the same side of the toroid. solder copper tubing into PCBs.
On PCB with two solder contacts, with the offsets facing down the right side is the positive contact. The left side is to wrap the toroid. 
Using 12in of wire solder the left contact with the wire leading away from the toroid. Run the wire into the opposite side copper tube.
Both copper tubes should have 2 passes of the wire. After the second wrap turn the wire back into the left side tube and out the top. This will be your antenna connection.
Solder a length of wire to the right side contact, this will be your positive connection.
The last contact at the top of the toroid on the side will be for ground. Pass your wire through the bottom hole and solder into top contact. 
When connecting ground to your terminal run another length of wire to ground on your connector. 
Solder wires to terminals, positive to your connector and place in a housing. Offsets are there to prevent the unit from contacting and melting the housing 
due to the loss associated with this type of matching unit.
